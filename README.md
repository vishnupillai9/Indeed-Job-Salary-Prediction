# Indeed Job Salary Prediction
Predicting salaries of job listings on Indeed using their descriptions. 

A model is built to predict the job salaries of listings on Indeed using their descriptions. Indeed is one of the largest search engines for job listings. A subset of the data on the site is scraped to predict the job salaries.

### Getting the data
The data can be downloaded inline in the notebook or using the `scraping_script.sh` file which scrapes the data from Indeed for job titles and stores them in the `jobs.csv` file.

### Executing the code
All the code for this project is in the `notebook.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
